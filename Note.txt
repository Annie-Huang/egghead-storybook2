Because I start from the branch of master, which already has the below infomration. If you start from the beginning, do the following:
C:\react\egghead-storybook2>yarn init -y
C:\react\egghead-storybook2>yarn add -D @storybook/react babel-core
C:\react\egghead-storybook2>yarn add react react-dom
C:\react\egghead-storybook2>mkdir .storybook src
C:\react\egghead-storybook2>touch .storybook/config.js

----------


C:\react\egghead-storybook2>npm run storybook
C:\react\egghead-storybook2>yarn add -D @storybook/addons storybook-addon-jsx

Found out that the intial package.json that has "@storybook/react": "^3.4.8" does not compatable with latest version of other library. 
Ended up remove node_module, yarn.lock, package.json's dependencies and devDependencies and reinstall all the module required. 
Also decided to use npm install of yarn.

C:\react\egghead-storybook2>npm install --save-dev @storybook/addon-info
